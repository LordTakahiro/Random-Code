		<p id="1" hidden> (Sister's name): "(Player name)!!!" calls out to you with an enthusiastic tone, "Are you ready yet?! </br>
		I feel like I've been ready for HOURS!!!" </br>
</br>
		You chuckle to yourself as you finish buttoning up your pants, "I'm coming, I'm coming, don't get too excited or I might just </br>
		change my mind and sell that dress to get the horse we need."</br>
</br>
		Your sister jumps in through the threshold of your doorway to stand in front of you with a scowl. "Don't you DARE do such a thing </br>
		to me! How could you live with yourself if you do not allow the magnificent people of Ravensgate to see this majestic dress?!" </br>
		She twirls around in front of you, the frills of her dress brushing against your legs. </br>
</br>
		"I'm sure someone would buy that and wear it to the ball if I sold it quick enough..." </br>
		You say with a smirk on your face, clearly joking.</br>
</br>
		"HEY!" She exclaims as she hits your arm, "I did not spend days sewing this dress just for you to get a stupid horse! Hmph!" </br>
		She crosses her arms and pouts.</br>
</br>
		You laugh softly and pat her head, "C'mon lets get going, we will be late if you don't hurry up."</br>
