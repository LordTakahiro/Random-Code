		<font size="4"> You live on a small farm on the outskirts of Ravensgate. Your father left your mother three years ago and </br>
		never returned back home. You found your mother, two months after your father left, hanging inside of the barn. She could not </br>
		deal with the grief of losing your father, and not being able to put food on the table for you and your younger sister, so she </br>
		took her own life. </br>
</br>
		Since then you have run the farm and slowly but surely increasing it's profit, season by season. It is just you and your sister </br>
		now dealing with the harsh realities of the world, together.</br>
</br>
		One day a courier came to your door with a letter for you. The letter stated that there was going to be a grand ball held within</br>
		the castle and you and your sister were invited. You did not want to go to this ball, but your sister has always dreamt of going </br>
		to one of the Queen's balls. Your sister begs and pleads with you to go and you finally give in. You spend the all of the money </br>
		you were saving up, to get a new plow horse, to get your little sister a dress for the ball. </br>
</br>
		It is now the night of the ball, what is in store for you and (your sisters name)?</br></br></font>
